# Cook Buddy

### Motivation:

The current COVID scenario and the associated lockdown resulted in a lot of difficulties, especially for those who didn’t know how to cook or weren’t experts in it. People were locked in their houses with limited supplies and had to make do with whatever was available with them. As a result, I thought what if we could have an application that can suggest us what to cook based on the resources, we have available at home. At the same time, it is essential that we keep track of our calories so I thought of having a tracker for that too to ensure we take in a healthy diet without compromising on our health.

### Idea:

CookBuddy is an application that will assist the user in the kitchen and give suggestions to the user based on what is available at home. They just have to enter the items that are available and the app will give suggestions for various recipes. Every time the user stocks up on supplies, they can update it in the app and after every dish made, the app will automatically reduce the quantity of all the items. This will also reduce the wastage of food as the user can see all the items available in the refrigerator. In addition to this, the user can keep track of the calories consumed etc. Based on the ingredients of our dish, the intake of calories are updated and we can keep an eye on our eating habits and ensure a healthy diet.

### Features:

- The user has the capability to enter the items available in the kitchen/refrigerator. They can enter the name of the item as well as the quantity. 
- Every time the user goes shopping, they can add what was bought as well as the quantity. 
- When the user wants to cook a dish, they just have to click a button and all the possible recipes that can be cooked will be shown on the screen. 
- Once the user picks a dish, the quantity of the ingredients will be reduced and the database is updated. 
- Graphical representation of the calories consumed over the week (PENDING)
